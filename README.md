# Tree

1) Left View of a Binary Tree.

2) Binary Search Tree to Greater Search Tree.

3) Construct BST from preorder traversal.

4) Maximum Binary Tree.

5) Sum of Cousins of a given Node in a Binary Tree.

6) Are two given nodes cousins in a binary tree.

7) Print all cousins of a given node in a binary tree.

8) LCA of a Binary tree. (keys given in form of nodes)
    Approach : a) Find path of the two given keys from the root of the tree
               b) Start traversing the paths and when a mismatch is found , return the node just before it i.e the lca of two nodes
